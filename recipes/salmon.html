    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Honey glazed salmon is a deliciously sweet and savory dish featuring
      tender, flaky salmon fillets coated in a rich glaze made from honey, soy
      sauce, garlic, and a hint of citrus. As it cooks, the glaze caramelizes,
      creating a beautiful golden crust that enhances the natural richness of
      the fish. Perfectly balanced in flavor, this dish pairs wonderfully with
      roasted vegetables, rice, or a fresh salad for a wholesome and satisfying
      meal.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Salmon</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>4 (6 oz each) salmon filets</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp kosher salt</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp black pepper</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp smoked paprika (or regular paprika)</li>
      <li>1/4 tsp blackening seasoning (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Sauce</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>3 Tbsp butter</li>
      <li>2 tsp olive oil</li>
      <li>6 cloves garlic minced</li>
      <li>1/2 cup honey</li>
      <li>3 Tbsp water</li>
      <li>3 Tbsp soy sauce</li>
      <li>1 Tbsp sriracha sauce</li>
      <li>2 Tbsp lemon juice</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Pat salmon dry, then season with salt, pepper, paprika and blackening
        seasoning (if using). Set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> Adjust oven rack to middle position, then
        preheat broiler. If you broil this with the rack up high the sauce will
        burn.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add butter and oil to a large, oven-safe skillet over MED-HIGH heat.
        Once butter is melted, add garlic, water, soy sauce, sriracha, honey and
        lemon juice and cook 30 seconds or so, until sauce is heated through.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add salmon, skin side down (if using salmon with skin), and cook 3
        minutes. While salmon cooks, baste frequently with sauce from the pan by
        spooning it over the top of the salmon.
      </li>
      <li>
        Broil salmon for 5-6 minutes, basting with sauce once during the broil,
        until salmon is caramelized and cooked to desired doneness.
      </li>
      <li>Garnish with minced parsley if desired.</li>
    </ol>
