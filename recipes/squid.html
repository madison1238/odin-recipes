    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Sautéed squid is a simple yet flavorful seafood dish featuring tender
      squid quickly cooked in a hot pan with olive oil, garlic, and aromatic
      herbs. The high-heat sautéing method ensures a perfectly tender texture
      while allowing the squid to soak up delicious flavors. Often finished with
      a squeeze of fresh lemon juice and a sprinkle of chili flakes, this dish
      is light, savory, and perfect as an appetizer or a main course served with
      crusty bread or a fresh salad.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 lb of cleaned squid, tubes and tentacles</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil</li>
      <li>3 garlic cloves, minced</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons fresh parsley, chopped</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon of dried Calabrian chili peppers</li>
      <li>1 pint of tomato sauce</li>
      <li>Salt and pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Clean and cut the calamari into rings about a half inch wide.</li>
      <li>In a large frying pan, add a couple tablespoons of olive oil.</li>
      <li>
        Put the pan on medium high heat and add your chopped garlic and the
        dried Calabrian chili pepper flakes. Allow the garlic and Calabrian
        chili peppers to heat up slowly and flavor the oil. If the garlic is
        starting to cook too fast, turn the stove down to low heat to prevent it
        from burning. This should take 2-3 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pat your raw calamari with a paper towel to remove any excess moisture.
        Now add your raw calamari to the pan. Make sure you put in the calamari
        rings and tentacles.
      </li>
      <li>Season the calamari with salt and black pepper.</li>
      <li>
        With the pan on medium heat, keep the calamari moving by tossing the pan
        or stirring it with a wooden spoon for about 2 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        When the calamari starts to become firm and develop a sear on the
        outside, add the tomato sauce and parsley. Let the squid simmer in the
        tomato sauce for another 3-4 minutes on medium high heat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Taste the calamari during the process and put in some additional salt if
        needed.
      </li>
      <li>Adjust the heat by adding more dried chili peppers if needed.</li>
      <li>Transfer the cooked squid and sauce to a plate and enjoy!</li>
